# Telemetry

One structured stream in the core (`tracing`), one redaction step, several sinks.
Code: `crates/telemetry`.

```text

UI errors (log_client) ──┼─▶ one record ─▶ redaction ─┬─▶ file   everything, always on, local
panics (panic hook) ─────┘    (fields,                ├─▶ stderr dev builds / THEODORE_LOG_STDERR=1
                               op_id, kind)           ├─▶ OTLP   warn + error, panics, traces
                                                      │          only with "Send error reports"
                                                      └─▶ PostHog product events only
                                                                 only with "Share anonymous usage data"
```

## What leaves the machine

| | Local file | Error reports (OTLP) | Usage data (PostHog) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Levels | info+ (or `THEODORE_LOG`) | warn, error | info (product events) |
| Kinds | all | logs, panics, UI errors, traces | `kind="product"` only |
| Repository names, paths, logins | kept | hashed | never present |
| Debug / trace | if enabled | never | never |
| Identifier | — | install id | install id |
| On by default | yes | no | no |

Remote sinks need two things: an endpoint (env, setting or compiled in) **and** the user's
recorded choice. Until onboarding (or Settings) records a choice, nothing is sent and nothing is
queued — records are dropped. Sandbox and fixture runs never have remote sinks; tests and the
CLI never start telemetry at all.

**Anonymous, precisely:** both remote sinks identify the app by a random install id (a UUID in
`<data dir>/telemetry/install_id`), never by the Theodore account. No account id, email, name or
host login goes into any property. Repository names and paths are hashed with a key unique to the
install. PostHog events set `$process_person_profile: false` and `$geoip_disable: true`; PostHog
still sees the request's IP address — turn on "Discard client IP data" in the project settings.
What the UI promises: *not linked to your account, email or code; repository names are hashed;
you can turn this off any time in Settings.*

## The choice

- **Onboarding**, right after sign-in: "Help improve Theodore" with two checkboxes, both checked —
  "Share anonymous usage data" and "Send error reports" — and a "What's collected" link (the event
  list and what's never sent, from the core's own catalog). The step only appears when the build
  has at least one remote sink; the choice is saved before Next advances.
- **Once, after sign-in**, for an install that onboarded before its build could send anything
  (so it never saw that step): the same choice in a dialog, Save or Don't share. It shows only
  while an available sink has no recorded choice, and never in sandbox mode.
- **Settings → About & updates → Privacy**: the same two switches, each independent.
- Stored as settings `telemetry.usage` and `telemetry.errors` (absent = no choice yet). Turning one
  off stops its sink at once and drops what it had queued.

## Product events

Typed (`ProductEvent`), fixed field names, emitted as `tracing` records on target
`theodore::product` with `kind="product"`. Fields are counts, durations, flags or values from a
fixed set — never code, paths, titles or comment text. The wire shape is pinned by
`crates/telemetry/tests/product_events.json`.

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `app_started` | `version`, `channel` |
| `signed_in` | — |
| `onboarding_step` | `step` (`account`, `telemetry`, `github`, `agents`, `projects`, `done`) |
| `pr_opened` | `host` (`github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `local`) |
| `grouping_done` | `ms`, `valid_first_try`, `groups`, `hunks`, `agent`, `chunks` |
| `grouping_failed` | `code` (an error code below) |
| `skill_run` | `skill` (a built-in id, else `custom`), `agents`, `findings`, `ms` |
| `chat_asked` | `scope` (`pr`, `group`, `hunk`) |
| `task_delegated` | `agent` |
| `task_decided` | `accepted` |
| `review_submitted` | `comments`, `review_event` (`approve`, `request_changes`, `comment`) |
| `merge` | `method` |
| `space_created` | `mode` |
| `space_turn` | `ms`, `mode`, `ok` |
| `space_shipped` | `how` (`open_pr`, `open_draft_pr`, `push`, `merge_locally`, `keep_branch`) |
| `config_saved` | `where` (`global`, `repo`, `local`) |
| `problem_reported` | `mode` (`issue`, `issue_with_logs`, `logs_only`) |

Every PostHog event also carries `app_version`, `os`, `channel` (the update channel), `commit`
and `build_env` (`production`, `staging`, `nightly`, `dev`; docs/releasing.md "Build stamp").
The UI can report only `onboarding_step` (`track_ui`), and the core drops values it doesn't know.

## Error codes

Failures are logged with a stable dotted `error.code`, plus context: `agent` and
`agent_version`, `duration_ms`, `attempt`, the PR (hashed remotely), `exit_code`.

| Area | Codes |
|---|---|
| Grouping | `grouping.invalid_output`, `grouping.agent_failed`, `grouping.repaired` (a repair round or the Other fallback was needed) |
| Host | `host.unauthorized` (401), `host.forbidden` (403), `host.rate_limited`, `host.not_found`, `host.conflict`, `host.validation`, `host.network`, `host.server_error`, `host.protocol`, `host.auth` (as the app sees 401/403), `host.forbidden` also for a GraphQL mutation refused as `FORBIDDEN` |
| Agent | `agent.crashed` (non-zero exit / error, with `stderr_tail` ≤ 2 KB), `agent.timed_out`, `agent.stalled`, `agent.spawn_failed`, `agent.not_installed`, `agent.offline` (info: the CLI couldn't reach its servers — a run, a grouping, a space turn) |
| Git | `git.command_failed`, `git.auth`, `git.network` (the remote can't be reached; expected, logged at info), `git.not_installed`, `git.refused`, `git.unsupported`, `git.parse`, `git.io` |
| Store | `store.db`, `store.serde`, `store.migration` |
| Outbox | `outbox.gave_up` |
| Spaces | `space.command_failed`, `space.command_timed_out`, `space.turn_failed` |
| Account | `account.refresh_rejected`, `account.rejected`, `account.network`, `account.invalid_token`, `account.config`, `account.protocol`, `account.required` |
| Other | `skill.failed`, `app.not_found`, `app.invalid`, `app.internal`, `app.start_failed`, `app.offline_not_cached`, `app.offline` (offline and the project was never cloned), `panic` |
| UI | `ui.uncaught`, `ui.unhandled_rejection`, `ui.render_crash` |

A grouping run also logs `grouping done` (local file) with `duration_ms` and `first_group_ms`,
when its first group was shown; the same `first_group_ms` is recorded on the run's `grouping`
span. Without streaming (Codex, Gemini) it equals `duration_ms`.

`AppError::code()` maps every app error; command failures are logged once, at the command
boundary, inside the command's span.

## Operation ids

Every IPC call carries an `op_id` (16 hex chars made in `ui/src/core/api.ts`, sent as the
`x-theodore-op` invoke header). The command runs in an `op` span with `op_id` and `cmd`; agent
runs, grouping and host requests it starts stay in that span, so one failure stitches together
from UI to core to agent to host. `CommandFailure.opId` in the UI is the same id. Outbox writes run
later, in their own `outbox_item` span.

Every command ends with one `command done` line carrying `ok` and `ms` (and `error_code` when it
failed); the same fields land on the exported trace, so New Relic shows each command's duration
and outcome. Info level, debug for the chatty ones (sync, polls, passive reads); a chatty command
isn't exported as a trace either. Why a command failed is logged once, where its error is mapped.

## Redaction

Shared, unit-tested (`crates/telemetry/src/redact.rs`), applied to every record before any sink —
the file included.

- **Secrets in any text:** GitHub tokens (`gh[pousr]_…`, `github_pat_…`), GitLab (`glpat-…` and
  the other `gl…-` prefixes), Atlassian/Bitbucket (`ATBB…`, `ATATT…`), passwords in URLs
  (`https://user:pass@…`), `Bearer …`/`Basic …`, WorkOS keys (`sk_…`), JWTs, private keys,
  `Authorization`/`Cookie`/`Private-Token` headers, `code=`/`state=`/`token=`/`key=`… query
  parameters, and `token=`/`"secret": …`/`password: …` pairs.
- **Credential fields:** any field named or segmented `token`, `secret`, `password`,
  `authorization`, `cookie`, `code_verifier`, `api_key`, `credential(s)` → `[redacted]`.
- **Content fields:** `diff`, `hunk(s)`, `patch`, `body`, `comment(s)`, `content(s)`,
  `file_content(s)`, `prompt`, `markdown`, `snippet`, `blob`, `title`, `description`, `reply`,
  `suggestion`, `stdout`, `transcript`, `text` → `[omitted: N bytes]` (numbers stay: counts).
- **Emails** → `<email:hash>`; `git@host:…` remotes are kept.
- **Home directory** → `~`.
- **Length:** fields over 2 KB (stacks and backtraces: 8 KB, messages: 4 KB) are cut with
  `…[truncated N bytes]`; `*_tail` fields keep their end.
- **Remote only:** fields naming a repo, PR, branch, project, space, path, URL, login, user or
  account → `h:<hash>`; URLs keep scheme and host, their path becomes `<url:hash>`; paths become
  `<path:hash>`, except our own source in backtraces (`…/crates/…`). The local file keeps names.

## Settings and environment

| Setting | Env | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `telemetry.usage` | — | "Share anonymous usage data" (bool; absent = not chosen) |
| `telemetry.errors` | — | "Send error reports" (bool; absent = not chosen) |
| `telemetry.otlp.endpoint` | `THEODORE_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP/HTTP base URL; `/v1/logs` and `/v1/traces` are appended |
| `telemetry.otlp.headers` | `THEODORE_OTLP_HEADERS` | `k=v,k2=v2`, e.g. `api-key=…` |
| `telemetry.posthog.host` | `THEODORE_POSTHOG_HOST` | default `https://us.i.posthog.com` |
| `telemetry.posthog.key` | `THEODORE_POSTHOG_KEY` | the project API key |
| `log.level` | `THEODORE_LOG` | `info` by default; a level or `tracing` directives (`info,theodore_app=debug`); the env wins |
| — | `THEODORE_LOG_STDERR` | mirror the log to stderr outside debug builds |
| `report.github_repo` | `THEODORE_FEEDBACK_REPO` (build time only) | where "Report a problem" opens issues, `owner/name`; default `JeanIsahakyan/theodore`; the setting wins |

Each sink resolves from the first source that sets it — env, then setting, then compiled in
(`option_env!` of the same `THEODORE_*` names; the release workflow passes repository variables
and the `THEODORE_OTLP_HEADERS` secret). Endpoint and credentials come from the same source. No
keys are committed. Both sinks batch through bounded queues, never block the UI, drop on overflow
or after their retries, and flush on quit.

### New Relic

```sh
THEODORE_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net \
THEODORE_OTLP_HEADERS="api-key=<ingest license key>" \
cargo run -p theodore-desktop
```

EU accounts use `https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net`. Logs arrive with `service.name=theodore`,
`service.instance.id=<install id>`, `service.version`, `vcs.ref.head.revision` (the commit),
`deployment.environment.name` (the build environment), `theodore.update_channel` and `os.type`,
and correlate with traces by trace id.

### PostHog

```sh
THEODORE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com THEODORE_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_… cargo run -p theodore-desktop
```

Events go to `/batch/` in batches of up to 50 (or every 30 s), retried with backoff on 5xx/429
and network errors, dropped on another 4xx or after 4 attempts.

Either way, choose "Help improve Theodore" in onboarding or flip the switches in Settings —
nothing is sent before that.

## The local log

`<data dir>/logs/theodore.jsonl` (`~/.theodore/logs/` in production, `~/.theodore-<env>/logs/` in
other builds, `~/.theodore-sandbox/logs/` in sandbox mode): one JSON object per line — `ts`, `level`, `target`, `kind`, `msg`, `spans`, then
the fields (`op_id`, `cmd`, `error.code`, …). Rotated daily and at 10 MB into
`theodore-<date>-<time>.jsonl`, at most 9 old files and 50 MB in total.

```sh
cd ~/.theodore/logs
jq -c 'select(.level == "error" or .level == "warn")' theodore.jsonl     # problems
jq -c 'select(."error.code" == "agent.crashed") | {ts, agent, exit_code, stderr_tail}' theodore.jsonl
jq -c 'select(.op_id == "3f9c0a1b2c3d4e5f")' theodore*.jsonl              # one operation, end to end
jq -r 'select(.kind == "product") | .event' theodore.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
tail -f theodore.jsonl | jq -c '{ts, level, msg, "error.code"}'
```

## Report a problem

Settings → About & updates, Help → Report a Problem…, the account menu, or the "Something went
wrong" screen. One dialog, three modes:

| Mode | Sends | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Open an issue** | title, comment, app-info table | a **public** issue on GitHub, as you |
| **Open an issue with logs** | the same + the newest redacted log lines, folded in `<details>` | the same |
| **Save logs only** | nothing | a zip on disk for you to attach yourself |

```text
issue_target ─▶ repo + @login, or why not ─▶ modes 1–2 enabled / disabled with that reason
preview_issue(title, comment, with_logs) ─▶ draft id + the exact body  (app info, log lines kept)
submit_issue(…, draft) ─▶ POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, label from-app ─▶ #N + link
                          └─ label refused (422/403) ─▶ once more without it
```

- **Issues** go to `JeanIsahakyan/theodore` — or `THEODORE_FEEDBACK_REPO` (`owner/name`) at build
  time, or the `report.github_repo` setting (for a scratch repo). They are posted with your own
  GitHub token (keychain → `gh` → `GITHUB_TOKEN`, as everywhere); the dialog says "Posted publicly
  as @login on github.com/…" and requires a title and a comment.
- **App info** in an issue: version, update channel, commit, build environment and date, macOS
  version, architecture. No install id, no account, no agent CLIs, no paths.
- **Logs** in an issue are the zip's lines — the same files, the same remote-rule redaction
  (`report::log_tail`) — but only the newest ones: GitHub caps a body at 65,536 characters, so
  the logs get what the comment and table leave, and the summary says how many older lines were
  cut. A fence longer than any backtick run in them keeps a log line from closing it.
- **Preview** shows the body exactly as posted (logs folded). The post reuses the preview's draft,
  so it sends the app info and log lines the preview showed; the draft is dropped after posting.
- **No GitHub sign-in, sandbox or fixture runs**: modes 1–2 are disabled with a one-line reason;
  sandbox and fixture runs have no issue tracker at all, so they can't reach GitHub even if asked.
  Errors show inline: an expired token reads "GitHub sign-in expired …".
- **The zip** (`Save logs only`): `<tmp>/theodore-reports/theodore-report-<stamp>.zip` with
  `app-info.json` (version, commit, build environment and date, OS, agent CLI versions) and the
  newest logs up to 20 MB, redacted again with the remote rules (repository names and paths
  hashed). The dialog lists the files for review, then **Reveal in Finder** or **Copy summary**.
- Either way, `problem_reported` records only the mode, never the text or the issue.

## UI errors

`window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection` and the top-level error boundary forward to `log_client`
(deduped and rate-limited in the UI and again in the core): message, stack, React component stack,
the route name only, and the failed command's `op_id` when there is one.
