# Spaces — the stage before a pull request

A **space** is a change while it is being made. You open one in a project, say
what you want, and an agent writes the code in an isolated worktree while you
watch the diff, review it by meaning, and send comments back. When it is good,
the space becomes a pull request — its turns squashed into one commit by
you on its own branch — and Theodore's existing review, inbox and merge flow
takes over. In a local folder it is merged into the checked-out branch
instead, or kept as a branch.

On for everyone; the `labs.build_mode` setting turns them off (Settings →
Spaces, §10).

## 1. One object, three stages

```

```

The PR is the space's continuation, not a copy: `space.pr` points at it, the
space page shows its state, reviewer threads become agent tasks in the same
space, and a push from the space updates the PR.

| Stage | Space shows | Who acts | Ends when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Drafting | chat · live diff vs base | you + the agent | Open PR / Merge locally / Keep as branch |
| In review | the same, plus the PR's Threads and Checks tabs and Merge | reviewers → you → the agent | merged (here or on the host) or closed |
| Done | transcript and final diff; Continue | — | Continue (drafting again, new branch) or archived (auto, `spaces.auto_archive_days` after merge, merge locally or keep) |

## 3. Where spaces live in the UI

**Decision: a "Spaces" section in every workspace's sidebar, below its
sections (Overview · Inbox · My PRs · Tasks · Skills), plus a "Drafting"
group at the top of My PRs.** Two views over one object, not
a separate feature island.

- The sidebar is "what needs you now". Agents run in parallel and finish at
  unpredictable times; their state must be visible at a glance without
  opening anything — the same job the Inbox count does for review requests.
- My PRs is "all my changes, by stage": Drafting · In review · Merged. A space
  moves down that list as it moves through its stages.
- ⌘K "New space…" and the section's `+` both open the same dialog. ⌘K alone
  would hide running work.
- In "All projects" the section lists every project's spaces, prefixed with
  the project name; "New space" asks which project.
- A local-folder workspace has no Inbox or My PRs; its Spaces section is the
  only list, and Overview → Branches shows each space's branch.

### Sidebar

```
┌ ● migratro ▾ ──── ⌘K ┐

└──────────────────────┘
```

| Glyph | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ◐ | agent running | `space.status = running` |
| ● | a turn ended or a question came since you last looked; a plan is ready when its turn ends | `space.attention_at` > last seen (UI-local); other writes that bump `updated_at` (PR opened, Update from base, undo, archive) don't light it |
| ○ | idle | `idle` |
| ✕ | last turn failed or was interrupted | `failed` |
| ⎇ #n | has a PR; tinted by its checks (green · red · amber), the merge icon once merged | `space.pr` + its `pr` row (`checks`, `state`) |

◐, ✕ and ● win over ⎇; the label keeps `#n` either way.

**Pin / mark as unread** (finding a space again, GitHub #77): right-click
a row, or type "pin"/"unread" in ⌘K.

```
┌ Spaces             + │
│ ● fix-login-redirect │  pinned (small pin mark) — sorts first
│ ◐ add-csv-export     │  running
│ ● tidy-config        │  turn done, not seen yet
└──────────────────────┘
  right-click ▸ Pin/Unpin · Mark as unread · Archive
```

| | Field | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pin | `space.pinned` (synced) | `set_space_pinned` only — never a client transaction, like the rest of `space` |
| Mark as unread | the UI-local seen mark (`seen.ts`) | forgets the space was seen, so it reads ● again and counts toward the dock badge, without waiting for a new turn |

Unread comes from `attention_at`, not `updated_at`, so pinning (or any other
write) doesn't make a space read as a new turn. Pinned spaces sort first, then by activity, in both
the sidebar and ⌘K.

**Archive from the row**: hovering a space row (or focusing it with the
keyboard) shows a small Archive button over its right edge, on a fade so
the label doesn't shift. Pressing it archives that space only — it never
opens or selects the row. It is the page header's button: disabled while a
turn runs, and the page steps back only when the archived space is the one
open. The right-click menu has the same Archive item.

**⌘F searches the current list** (GitHub #77): the PR list on Inbox / My
PRs (title, number, author, repo, branch), or this section everywhere
else build mode is on (name, title, goal, branch). Fuzzy-ish substring
match; Esc clears the query, then closes; ↑↓ moves, ⏎ opens. Never on
`review` or `space` (a diff/text view) — the key is left for the
webview's own find there; `settings` has no sidebar to search either.

### New space

```
┌ New space ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Project    migratro                        ▾    │
│ What should change?                             │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Retry the export job on 429s with backoff   │ │

│                              [Cancel] [Start ⏎] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

"Start" creates the worktree and sends the goal as the first message — the
first turn starts immediately. Name and branch are derived from the goal and
editable.

| Goal | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Retry the export job on 429s | `retry-the-export-job-on` (first five words) |
| исправить логин | `ispravit-login` (Cyrillic transliterated) |
| Crème brûlée für Straße | `creme-brulee-fur-strasse` (accents dropped) |
| 修复登录 | `space` (other scripts only break words) |
| a second "исправить логин" in the project | `ispravit-login-2`, and so its branch |

That slug is only the instant placeholder. Without delaying turn 1, the
chat agent (`agents.chat`, its fastest, cheapest model — Claude's `haiku`)
proposes a better one from the goal, in the background:

```
create_space ─▶ slug name, turn 1 sent ──▶ page opens at once
                      │
                      └─▶ space_naming::apply (background)
                              chat agent, cheap model ─▶ "NAME: … / TITLE: …"
                              name/branch ─▶ applied, deduped          (unless you typed one, or it shipped)
                              title       ─▶ applied                   (always, once a valid answer lands)
                              anything else (offline, no CLI, a bad
                              answer) ─▶ nothing changes, silently
```

`Space::title` is what the sidebar, palette, tab and notifications show
(`spaceTitle`) instead of the goal's raw first line — the fix for chats
that otherwise read as a run-on sentence ("For LIN-145, I dont agree with
the proposed solution…", GitHub #78). Open PR / Merge locally's own title
field still defaults to the goal's first line (`defaultTitle`), on
purpose: that one is the commit message, not the chat's name.

#### Start from an issue, a branch, or a PR

A "Start from" chip next to the goal switches what the space starts on,
instead of a fresh `<login>/<slug>` forked from the goal
(`CreateSpaceRequest.start_from` / `SpaceStart`):

```
goal (default)  ──▶ fork <login>/<slug> off the project's default branch
issue            ──▶ get_issue; goal := title + body + a link; number kept
                     for ship_space's PR body ("Closes #<number>")
branch           ──▶ resolve the branch's tip; worktree starts there
pr               ──▶ get_pr; same as branch, plus Space.pr set right away
                     (opens "In review", not "Drafting")
```

| | branch / name | worktree starts at | shipping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| goal | `<login>/<slug>`, new | `base_sha` | Open PR: pushes the new branch |
| issue | `<login>/<slug>`, new | `base_sha` | same, body says "Closes #n" |
| branch | the adopted branch, kept | its own tip (`fork_sha`) | pushes back to it, never a fresh branch |
| pr | the PR's branch, kept | its own tip (`fork_sha`) | Push (the PR already exists) |

An issue needs a host that can read its own issues
(`Capabilities::issues`; GitHub and GitLab, not Bitbucket) — the picker
lists the project's open ones, yours first (`open_issues`), or a pasted URL /
`#<number>` resolves directly (`get_issue`). A host without issues says so
in the picker instead of a toast; a local folder doesn't offer the choice.
The line under the composer says what each choice does. The goal box becomes an
optional note on top of what's picked or typed, rather than required.

"Closes #n" goes in only while the issue is open: Open PR asks the host
(`get_issue`) and leaves it out for a closed one; when the host can't say,
it's left out after a Continue, the earlier round's PR having closed it.

### Space page — drafting

Chat left, changes right. The diff is the whole branch vs its base, the same
`DiffPane` the review uses. While a turn runs it follows the agent's edits
(below); when the turn ends, its checkpoint replaces that.

```
turn runs ─▶ every 3 s: space_fingerprint (HEAD + `status` + size/mtime)
               ├─ same ─▶ nothing
               └─ changed ─▶ space_snapshot (temp index, no ref)
                               ├─ same commit ─▶ nothing
                               └─ new ─▶ review head = snapshot ─▶ diff refreshes
turn ends ─▶ live diff stopped ─▶ checkpoint ─▶ review head = checkpoint
```

A live snapshot is never a checkpoint: no ref, no `turn_log` entry; the
worktree's index isn't written (`status --no-optional-locks`).

```

```

**A turn in the chat** is a timeline: what the agent wrote, one line per
tool call, its subagents and its thinking, strictly in the order they
happened; rows never reorder. It stays on the reply (`activity`, `duration_ms`,
`changed_files`, `model`), so it survives a restart, and it never goes into a
prompt.

```

              AgentDelta ──────▶ onto the last text row of the run's own

              RunStepDone id ──▶ marks that call, whichever is newest
              12s under the rows: ticks through its node, no render
              │ the reply lands (its stored steps take over)
              ▼

```

`RunLog` stays what the AI panel reads (`summarizeTools`), one line per call,
a subagent's too; the timeline doesn't read it.

**The fold** (`turnRows.ts`). A running turn never folds.

| In a finished turn | Shows as |
| --- | --- |
| a failed tool, a question asked, a plan | always a row |
| the last text, when no reply text follows the steps | always a row |
| all text, when the turn stopped or failed | always a row |
| 3 or more others between those | one line: `3 tool calls, 5 messages, 2 agents` and each kind of tool's icon |
| fewer than 3 | flat |

Thinking isn't counted and goes with what's around it; a subagent's steps count
for nothing either. What's closed isn't rendered. The open state is kept by row
id, in memory.

**A tool row**: an icon, a label, a muted monospace chip, one line, truncating
with a tooltip.

| Tool | Label | Chip / after it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| command | its `description`, or `Run` | the command |
| read | `Read 120 lines` when the result says | the file |
| grep, glob | `grep for 'x' in src` | `5 matches` |
| edit | `Edit` | the file, `+3 −1` from the input |
| write | `Write 12 lines` | the file |
| question | `Waiting for your answer`, then `Asked you` | the question |
| anything else | what it does | its target |

Consecutive calls of one read-only tool, or to one MCP server, are one row once
the turn is done: `Read 4 files` opens on them. Edits and commands stay a row
each. Thinking is a muted one-line chip, opening as markdown.

**A subagent** (`Agent`/`Task`) is a row with its description. Claude Code
marks what it does with `parent_tool_use_id` (2.1.319, recorded in
`crates/agents/tests/fixtures/claude_subagent.jsonl`), so its text, thinking
and tools are `AgentEvent::Nested`, stored with `parent` and shown under the
row: its newest step beside it while it runs, all of them when opened. They
never reach the reply. Its `SubagentHandback` call is no row: its message is the
row's summary. A call that runs in the background gets only the CLI's launch
note back, which is plumbing for the agent and shows nowhere: the step is marked
`background` and the row says `running in background` (spinner) until its
report comes, `ran in background` once its turn is over. The report is the
CLI's `task_notification`, read as the call's result; the CLI then takes the
turn up again, and that text is the same turn's, after what came before
(`claude_subagent_background.jsonl`): the run ends at the last `result` once no
subagent works and none is left unanswered. A note beside a row is
one line; the full report shows when the row is opened. Codex and Gemini report
no nested steps.

**The files** of a turn come from git between its checkpoints (`before`..`after`,
at most 200) when it ends; a failure leaves them empty and never fails the
turn, and a turn that merged the base shows none. Up to 3 chips, then `+N more`
with the total of the rest. A chip opens the Changes pane on its file, `+N more`
the pane. On hover the time shows the model and start → end.

| Run ended with | Reply | Text in the steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a final text | that text | what it wrote before; blocks the final text repeats leave |
| no final text (stopped, failed, a CLI that only sends `Text`) | its text blocks, blank line between | all of it, in place, the block cut off last (`text_in_steps`); only those show |
| a handed-in plan | the plan | all it wrote |

At most 500 steps, the newest kept, and 100 per subagent; a text capped at 4000
characters unless the steps are all that show it, thinking at 1000, a step's
detail at 200, its summary at 300. If the bound took a text a no-final-text
run wrote, the reply tells it all instead. A run retried because its session is
gone starts its steps over. A CLI that reports no block starts gets one for each
whole text it sends; a text block is a paragraph of its own either way.

**Rows.** A space's chat is one row per turn, keyed by your message's id:
your message, the reply with its timeline and cards, and the live reply while
it runs. Only the rows near the view are mounted (`VirtualChat`, the one file
that knows about the virtualizer).

```
head   setup stage / note                stays mounted
turn   you ─ reply, timeline, cards      mounted near the view
turn   you ─ the live reply              the reply lands in this same row
tail   queued messages, the question     stays mounted
```

Nothing said yet is a plain page with the empty state, not a list. Find in
page only sees mounted rows.

| What changed | What re-renders |
| --- | --- |
| a key in the composer | the composer |
| a space field that says nothing about a message (progress, status) | not its row |
| a piece of streamed text | the live timeline, at most once per frame |

**Scrolling** follows new content only while you are at the bottom (within
80px). Scrolled up, nothing moves you and a "Jump to latest" pill takes you
back; only sending a message of your own also does. A space's chat reopens where you left it scrolled up (in memory, by
space), by the turn and the offset into it, so turns that came or grew since
don't move your place; any input of yours ends the restore. Left at the bottom,
or opened for the first time, it opens at the bottom.

**What you do shows before the core answers**, in the row it belongs to:

```
send ──▶ your message + working dots, at once       (starting a turn can take a while)
           ├─ its row arrives ─▶ takes over in the same chat row, nothing remounts
           └─ refused ─────────▶ gone, the text and files back in the box

```

Opening or closing a fold, a group, a subagent, a thinking row or a check is instant and
moves nothing: the row you clicked stays where it is, also at the bottom, where
the sizer holds the room a closed row gave back until you scroll up or new
content fills it. What is open survives scrolling away and leaving the space (in
memory, by message).

`/skill` in a space's chat runs your Claude skills (`~/.claude/skills`, the
repo's `.claude/skills`) as that turn's instructions; review built-ins aren't
offered there. The skill's `SKILL.md` goes into the agent's prompt with the
rest of the message as the task (none → "apply it to the work in this
space"); the chat keeps the text as typed. Same id in both places → yours
runs. An unknown `/word` is sent as is.

**Attachments**: a message can carry files — images, PDFs, anything up to
25 MB each. `save_attachment` stores one under
`<data dir>/attachments/<id>/<name>` and returns its id; `space_send` (and
the AI panel's `ask`) take the ids. Your message keeps them
(`ChatMessage.attachments`, its text as typed); `attachment_data` gives an
image back as a `data:` URL for the transcript.

```
save_attachment ──▶ id ──▶ space_send { attachments: [id] }
                              ├─ your message: text as typed + attachments
                              └─ prompt: <text or skill expansion>
                                         Attached files (read them; …):
                                         - <abs path> (<mime>, <name>)
```

| Agent | Can open them by |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `--add-dir <attachment dir>`, then its Read tool (images, PDFs) |
| Codex | images as `-i <path>`; other files by path (its sandbox reads anywhere) |
| Gemini | the path in the prompt only |

Later turns name an earlier message's files — `(attached: shot.png)` — but
don't send them again.

**Undo, rewind, revert**

| Where | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Undo on the last reply (⌘K "Undo last turn") | back to where that turn started; again walks back one more |
| "Back to here" on an earlier reply | back to right after that turn: every later one at once |
| a file's menu in the diff → "Revert to base" | that file as in the base |
| a file's menu → "Revert the last turn's change" | that file as before the last agent turn |

```
turn 1 ─▶ ckpt A ─▶ turn 2 ─▶ ckpt B ─▶ turn 3 ─▶ ckpt C
Undo                                     turn 3 undone       ─▶ space at B
Back to here on turn 1      turn 2, 3 undone                 ─▶ space at A
any of them over a shipped turn ─▶ refused
Revert a.ts ─▶ a.ts restored ─▶ ckpt D, a turn_log entry of its own (Undo brings a.ts back)
             └▶ next prompt: "The user reverted `a.ts` since your last turn; don't redo
                that change unless asked."
```

- Undone turns stay in the chat, dimmed and marked *undone*; the next
  turns' prompts leave them out.
- Going back restores `HEAD` (as the agent left it then) and rewrites only
  the files whose content differs; untracked files that weren't there go,
  ignored ones (deps, build output) stay. A dev server watching the
  worktree sees only what changed (§6).
- A revert shows in the chat as your message ("Reverted `a.ts` to the
  base."); Undo sits on it like on a turn.
- Refused while a turn runs, on an archived space, with a rebase or merge
  unfinished in the worktree, and once the turn shipped (pushed, merged
  locally, or kept as a branch) — then ask the agent to revert it instead.
  Undo and Back to here also stop at a clean Update from base or a Continue:
  neither is a turn, and going back over one would put the old tree on the
  new base. A revert is refused while a turn runs, on an archived space, and when the
  file already is as asked.

**Update from base**: when the base branch has commits the space doesn't,
the header shows *Base moved: 3 commits behind · Update* (counted from the
copy on this Mac, re-read after each turn and each project fetch; no
network). Update merges the base into the space (§6): clean, the space is on
the new base at once; on conflicts a banner *Resolving conflicts with main:
a.ts, b.ts* replaces the button and the agent gets a turn to resolve them.

```
┌ ○ retry-429 ──────── [⎇ Base moved: 3 commits behind · Update] [Review] [Open PR ▾] ┐
                    after Update, on conflicts:
┌ ○ retry-429 ──────────────────────────────────────────── [Review] [Open PR ▾] ──────┐
│ ⚠ Resolving conflicts with main: src/retry.rs. Theodore commits    [Complete merge] │
│   the merge once no conflict markers are left.                     [Abort]          │
```

| Banner action | Does |
| --- | --- |
| (the agent's turn ends) | Theodore checks the files; none has markers left → it commits the merge |
| Complete merge | the same check now, for files fixed by hand; says which files still have markers |
| Abort | stops the agent's resolving turn if one runs, then `merge --abort`: worktree and ref back to where the update started, old base |

While it resolves: Ship, Undo, Back to here and Revert are refused ("finish or abort the update
from base first"), a plain message is a normal turn whose end tries the
merge again. Undo of the turn that completed the merge takes the merge back
too, base included; a clean update is not a turn, so Undo stops at it. The
PR's own "Update branch" on the host is a separate action and stays as is.

### Space page — in review

Once `space.pr` is set the header gains the PR and Merge, and the right
pane gains tabs: **Changes · Threads · Checks**. Everything a PR needs
happens here; "PR" still opens the normal review.

```
┌ ○ rate-limits ── In review · #123 ───────── [Review] [Push] [Merge ▾] [PR] ──────┐

└────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Tab | Shows | Reuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Changes | the live diff, as while drafting | `DiffPane` |
| Threads | the PR's threads and drafts: Reply · Resolve · Send to agent; unresolved count on the tab | the review side panel's `Threads` |
| Checks | review decision + approvals, mergeable state (`merge_info`), conflicting files (`conflicts`) with Update branch, then every check with Re-run (`rerun_check`) | `Checks`, `ReviewerStrip` |

The PR is asked for while the page is open (`refresh_space_pr`, one
conditional fetch by ETag, so an unchanged PR is a 304): every 10 s while
its checks run, every 30 s otherwise, never once it merged or closed. Its
review tab needn't be open for a failure to show. The Merge line agrees with
Merge: a draft or conflicts on the PR row say so even while `merge_info`
still says clean.

**Merge** (`merge_space`, through `merge_pr` and the outbox):

| PR state (`merge_info`) | Merge does |
| --- | --- |
| clean / unstable, mergeable | merges now |
| the base has a merge queue | adds it to the queue |
| blocked / behind / unknown, the repo allows auto-merge | turns on auto-merge |
| conflicts, a draft, auto-merge already on, in the queue | disabled, says why |
| turns not pushed yet | refused: Push first, so the merge has them |

The method is the host's default (GitHub `viewerDefaultMergeMethod`: your
last one, else the repo's) when the repo allows it, else the first allowed
one; ▾ picks another allowed method or opens the full merge dialog.

**Continue** — once the PR merged, a banner offers it instead of only
waiting for auto-archive (§7):

```
#123 merged ─▶ [Continue] ─▶ fetch main ─▶ branch ada/rate-limits-2 on main's tip
                              turns + chat stay · pr/shipped/done_at clear
                              next turn's prompt: "the previous PR (#123) merged…"
```

The next round's Open PR isn't about the goal any more, and its title is
never a sentence copied from the chat (an agent's reply is first person and
tells the round's story, edits it undid included). It is an imperative
summary of the round's net change (`ship_title.rs`):

```
net diff (base ─▶ head) ─┬─ empty ──────────────────────────▶ Update <name>
                         └─ chat agent, cheapest model, 30 s ─┬─ TITLE ok ─▶ title + SUMMARY bullets
   (diff stat + the agent's replies to the round's turns       └─ else ────▶ Update notes/t3.md
    that changed files; your messages never go in)                           Update 3 files in notes/
```

A proposed title is refused, never cut: over 72 characters, first person
("I created …"), or naming a path the net diff doesn't have. A summary line
is a whole sentence or dropped, the same way. The PR body is those lines,
the commit message the title and those lines. Open PR's title field starts
empty after a Continue; left empty, this is the title, typed, yours is.

**Send to agent** sits next to a thread's Resolve, a draft's edit/delete and
a finding's Add to review — in the diff and in the side panel — but only when
the PR is the space's (`space.pr`) or is the space's own branch review
(`space.review_pr`). It starts the space's next turn with a message that
quotes the comment and where it is:

```
Address this review feedback on the change.

Review thread on src/limiter.ts:41:
anna wrote:
> Should this be per-token, not global?

Change the code where the feedback applies. If you disagree with a point,
leave the code and say why. End with what you changed.
```

Several items (`space_send_feedback` takes a list) are numbered in one
message. Removed lines read `path:7 (old side, removed lines)`; outdated
comments say so; `<!-- … -->` metadata is dropped. The draft or thread itself
is left as it was.

**Fix CI**: "Fix with agent" next to the Checks tab heading, once a check on
`space.pr` has failed. It fetches each failing check's log (GitHub Actions
today; a host without one gets a bare link) and starts the space's next turn
with the list, each check's log attached or linked, and the project's
`spaces.check` command if one is configured:

```
space.pr ─▶ fresh checks ─▶ failing ones ─▶ check_log (GitHub Actions)
                                                │
                              save_attachment ◀─┴─▶ no log: name + url
                                    │
                                    ▼
                              space_send (one turn, attachments)
```

Refused without a PR, with nothing failing, or while a turn is running — same
rules as any other turn.

### Review of a space

"Review ▸" opens the normal Review tab for the space — groups by meaning, read
marks and progress, findings, skills. One difference while drafting:

```
┌ Review · fix-login-redirect (your space) ───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Groups           │ diff …                                         │ AI · Tasks   │
│ 1 Redirect guard │ + if (!isSameOrigin(next)) return '/'          │              │
│ 2 Login wiring   │   💬 "also handle //evil.com" (draft)           │              │
├──────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┤
│ 3 drafts · 1 finding               [Send 4 to agent ▸]   (replaces Submit review) │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A turn doesn't regroup (that would cost an agent run per turn). Once the
review was grouped, the review moving to a new checkpoint keeps the groups
and puts every hunk none of them holds in a last **Not grouped yet** group;
the file tree marks such a file `?`. Opening Review or Regroup groups the new
head for real.

Each draft and finding has its own "Send to agent" (above); the footer
sends every open one, plus a PR's unresolved threads, as one turn
(`space_send_feedback`). The space keeps what went (`sent_feedback`):

| An item that was sent | |
| --- | --- |
| its row | "sent to agent · turn N" |
| its own Send to agent | asks before sending it again (another turn) |
| the footer | counts it as "N sent", not as new; once its turn ends, its findings can be dismissed in bulk |

Tracking each item as a `task` assigned to the space's agent is planned.

### Notifications

| Event | Space open | Elsewhere in the app | App in background |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| turn finished | diff refreshes | toast "fix-login: turn done" [Open] + ● | notification "fix-login: turn finished" |
| turn failed | error in chat | error toast [Open] + ✕ | notification "fix-login: turn failed" + the error |
| agent asks (`ask_user`) | question card in chat | toast "fix-login: question" [Open] | notification "fix-login: question" + the first question |
| PR checks / reviews | header + tabs | existing inbox | existing |

"In the background" = the window isn't focused. The notification respects
`spaces.notify` (Settings → Spaces, default on); the shell sends it
(`notify_space`), so the window keeps only the plugin's permission check.
Clicking it brings the window forward and opens the space it was about:

```text
turn ends, window away ─▶ notify_space(id, title, body)
  Theodore.app on macOS ─▶ thread waits on the notification ─▶ click
  │    ─▶ focus window ─▶ `open-space` id ─▶ space opens            ⇒ true
  dev run / bare binary / other OS ─▶ notification plugin, no click ⇒ false
       ─▶ next window focus opens the space of the last notification
```

| | Clicks reported | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Theodore.app`, macOS | yes | posted under the app's own bundle id, `mac-notification-sys` waits for the click |
| dev run, bare binary | no | posted as Terminal; the click goes to Terminal |
| Linux, Windows | no | the plugin path, unchanged |

On macOS a notification waits on a thread of its own until it's clicked,
closed or cleared from Notification Center (the thread then ends); one left
in Notification Center keeps its thread until the app quits. At most 16
wait at once; past that a notification is only shown and falls back to the
next window focus. The dock badge counts the spaces whose last
turn ended after you last looked at them (finished or failed), plus the
spaces whose agent waits on your answer; a space only counts as seen while
the window has focus.

---

### Setup, run, check, archive

A space can be set up for its project by the `spaces:` section of the project
config — files copied in, free ports, env, and `setup` / `run` / `check` /
`archive` commands. Nothing configured gets `.env*` and 2 ports anyway, so a
space works with zero config; a project with no commands at all offers "Set
up with agent" instead, and a failed setup offers "Fix with agent" next to
Retry. See `docs/config.md`.

### Terminal

An interactive shell in the space's worktree, next to the agent's turns —
for `git log`, a one-off script, poking at something the agent just wrote.
Toggled from the header (and `⌃\``), it opens as a drawer under the page;
`+` starts another tab, × closes one. It spans the page's full width, is at
most 40% of the window's height (the chat keeps at least 200px), and the panes
above it clip to their own row.

```
⌃`   ──▶ drawer ── [Terminal 1] [Terminal 2] [+] ────────────────┐
           tab = one xterm.js view over one real PTY             │
           $SHELL -l, cwd = worktree, env = the space's own ◀────┘
```

- **Shell**: `$SHELL -l` (the user's login shell), so `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`
  aliases and prompt apply, same as a terminal app.
- **Env**: the parent process's env minus Theodore's own `THEODORE_*`
  secrets, plus the space's variables and `spaces.env` — the same
  `space_command_env` a space's `setup`/`run`/`check` commands get
  (docs/config.md).
- **Several per space, outlive the page.** Each tab is a real PTY the core
  owns, not the component; navigating away from the space page and back
  re-lists and re-attaches whatever is still running, scrollback included.
  Closed on archive (before the worktree is removed) and on a clean app
  quit — never left running past the space, or past Theodore itself.
- **Bounded, twice.** The core keeps a raw tail (ANSI intact) per terminal
  to reseed the view on reattach, and a separate ANSI-stripped line tail
  (`space_terminal_tail`, 2,000 lines) the agent reads as plain text
  through `read_terminal` (§5 "Tools the agent gets") and the composer's
  `@terminal` attaches (below).
- **`@terminal` in the composer**: typing it (confirmed by the space after,
  like `/skill`) attaches the space's most recently active terminal's last
  ~200 lines as a text attachment — the same `save_attachment` path a
  dropped file takes, shown as a chip in the strip and, once sent, in the
  transcript.
- **Flow control**: output is batched (16 ms or 64 KB, whichever first)
  before it reaches the UI, so a chatty shell can't flood the event bus.
- Follows the app's light/dark tokens, not a terminal palette of its own.

## 4. What makes it Theodore's

- **Review is the product.** The agent's diff is reviewed with the same
  grouping, read state, findings and skills as a teammate's PR. A
  space's review is an ordinary branch review (`open_branch` plumbing) whose
  head is the space's checkpoint.
- **Comments are instructions.** Drafts, findings and reviewer threads go to
  the space's agent as its next turn, quoted with their `path:line`. The
  loop "read → comment → agent fixes → read what changed" runs on the
  review you already use; tracking each as a `task` is planned.
- **Stages, not modes.** Writing code and reviewing it are one lifecycle;
  nothing is exported from one tool into another.

---

## 5. Agent control

| Mode | The agent may | Port mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ask | read, skills, subagents, todos, web, MCP; no writes or commands | `AgentMode::ReadOnly` |
| Plan | Ask, ending in a plan you approve or revise (below) | `AgentMode::Plan`: Claude `--permission-mode plan`; Codex `read-only`; Gemini `default` |
| Edit (default) | + edit files in the space | `AgentMode::Edit` |
| Run | + any shell command (tests, installs), no prompts | `AgentMode::Run`: Claude `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`; Codex `workspace-write` with network access; Gemini `--approval-mode yolo`. No sandbox of Theodore's own (§12 #4) |

Mode is picked next to Send (Ask · Plan · Edit · Run, `M` cycles) and sticky per space. Edit
is unchanged from before: Claude's Edit already pre-approves Bash, Codex's
`workspace-write` already runs commands in its own sandbox; Run lifts the
remaining prompts and limits.

- **Stop** cancels the run (SIGTERM → 5 s → SIGKILL, existing lifecycle), waits
  for the process to go, then checkpoints whatever was edited as "turn N
  (stopped)". Until then the space is still running: Undo and a new turn wait.
  Nothing is lost; messages queued behind it are held, not sent (§8).
- **Resume** = send another message. The space keeps one agent session and
  each turn continues it (below), so the agent still has the files it read,
  the commands it ran and its todo list; a different agent picks up from the
  replayed transcript.
- **Switch agent or model** per message (picker in the header).
- **Context**: `@path` mentions (stored as refs), `@terminal` attaches an
  open terminal's tail as a text attachment (§3 "Terminal"), paste a PR
  link to attach its description and diff stats, `/skill` runs a skill as
  the turn's instructions. The space's own commands come as MCP tools
  (below); a `get_space_context` (goal, diff stat, open tasks) is v2.
- **Scripts**: repo settings `spaces.setup` (v2; once, after create — e.g.
  `pnpm i`) and `spaces.check` (after each turn; a failing check is fed into
  the next turn). Output streams as run log lines.
- **Safety**:
  - The agent's cwd is `~/.theodore/spaces/<id>`, a worktree of Theodore's own
    cache. The user's checkout and its `.git` are never written. A local
    folder project uses the existing mirror.
  - Theodore never pushes, opens a PR or writes into a local folder unless
    you ask: a click, or asking the agent, which calls the `ship` tool
    (below). Either way it is the same ship, with the same guarantees.
  - The prompt tells the agent to stay in its directory, to ship only
    through `ship`, and never to run `git push`, `gh pr create` or switch
    branches itself. After each turn Theodore points the space ref at a
    snapshot on whatever `HEAD` is; the agent's own commits stay as it
    made them.
  - Theodore's secrets are stripped from the agent env (existing).
  - Every git command Theodore runs in the worktree first checks that git
    resolves exactly that worktree (§6 "Worktree guard"); otherwise nothing
    runs, so a lost `.git` never turns into `add -A` / `reset --hard` on a
    parent repository.
  - File-edit tools stay inside the worktree and the turn's attachment dirs
    (Edit and Run; Ask can't edit at all):

    | Agent | How | Verified |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Claude Code | no blanket `Edit`/`Write` allow; `--settings` with `Edit(//<dir>/**)` rules (Edit) and a `PreToolUse` hook on `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit\|NotebookEdit` (Edit and Run): Theodore's own binary run as `--theodore-edit-guard <dir>…` exits 2 for a path outside, symlinks resolved, `..` refused. The hook holds under `bypassPermissions` too | live, 2.1.312 |
    | Codex | its own `workspace-write` sandbox: writes only in cwd (plus `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR`), for shell and patches alike | flags only |
    | Gemini | its file tools refuse paths outside the workspace (the CLI's own check); nothing added | not installed here |

  - Not an OS sandbox: in Edit and Run, a shell command (Claude's Bash,
    Gemini's shell) can still write outside its directory. Later: run agents
    under a macOS sandbox profile that only allows writes inside the space
    (open question 4).

### Plan first

```text
Plan turn ─▶ reply = the plan, badge "plan" ─┬─ Approve ─▶ next turn in build_mode
 (explores, no edits)                        │    "Plan approved, implement it." in chat;
                                             │    the agent gets the plan in full
                                             └─ Revise ─▶ composer "What should change
                                                  in the plan?" ─▶ another Plan turn
```

- The plan: Claude Code's plan file (it has no `ExitPlanMode` under `-p`,
  so it writes `~/.claude/plans/*.md`; an `ExitPlanMode` call wins if one
  comes), else the turn's final message. Stored on its turn as
  `SpaceTurn::plan`, and as the reply's text, so a replayed transcript
  carries it.
- `build_mode`: the space's last Edit or Run, Edit when it had neither.
  Approve sends that mode explicitly, so the space leaves Plan.
- Approve / Revise sit only on the last live turn's plan, while no turn
  runs. A stopped or failed Plan turn has no plan.
- Every agent gets the same Plan rules in its system prompt: explore, edit
  nothing, end with context, numbered steps per file, how to verify.

### Questions

`ask_user` (on `space-tools`, every mode): 1–3 questions, each 2–4 options,
`multi` to pick several; "Other" (free text) is always offered.

```text
agent ─▶ ask_user ─▶ Space::question ─▶ card in chat + notice + badge
                       │
  Send answer ─────────┼─▶ tool result: question, selected, other ─▶ turn goes on
  Stop ────────────────┼─▶ "the user stopped the turn"
  30 min, no answer ───┼─▶ "go on with your best judgment and say what you assumed"
  restart ─────────────┴─▶ turn interrupted as any other
  (each way: Space::question cleared)
```

- One set at a time per space; a second `ask_user` while one waits is
  refused. Only the running turn's run may ask.
- The wait is in memory; the "agent is quiet" hint stays off while it waits.
- Answers are checked against the options (one per question unless `multi`).

### One session per space

Each run reports its CLI session id (Claude Code's `session_id`, Codex's
`thread_id`); the space stores it as `agent_session` (agent, id, worktree).
The next turn continues it and sends only the new message: skill expansion,
attachments, a failed `check` and the `ultracode` keyword wrap it as before,
but no transcript.

```
turn 1 ─▶ claude -p "<goal>"                         ─▶ session S ─▶ stored
turn 2 ─▶ claude -p "<message>" --resume S           ─▶ session S
          codex exec … resume S "<message>"
gone?  ─▶ "No conversation found" / "no rollout found"
          └─▶ once more, new session + replayed transcript ─▶ session S'
```

| Next turn | Continues the session? |
| --- | --- |
| same agent, same worktree | yes; the model and mode may change (flags are per run) |
| another agent | no: new session from the replayed transcript (last 12 messages) |
| Gemini | never: it has no resume, every turn replays the transcript |
| after Undo or Back to here | no: the session holds the undone turns; the replay leaves them out |
| after unarchive | yes (the worktree path is the same); no if the checkpoints were gone |
| the resumed run failed for another reason | the session stays for the next turn |

- Claude Code's system prompt (`--append-system-prompt`) and permissions go
  on every turn. Codex's thread already opens with the system prompt (folded
  into its first message), so a resumed turn doesn't repeat it; a resumed Plan
  turn does, as the thread may have opened without the Plan rules.
- A turn that ran without a session (Gemini, or a switch) clears the stored
  one: the conversation moved on without it.
- Review runs (AI panel, grouping, skills, fixes) don't keep sessions.

**The replayed transcript, once a space outgrows it.** The last 12 messages
carry the conversation across a switch, but a space with more history than
that would otherwise lose everything before them. The first time a turn
can't resume hits that case, the chat agent's cheap model summarizes
whatever falls outside the window (goal, decisions, files touched, what's
left) once; the summary is cached on the space (`handoff_summary`) and
prepended ahead of the replayed window on every switch after that — no
second call:

```
history > 12 messages, can't resume
  cached already?      ──yes──▶ prepend it
  no  ──▶ chat agent, cheap model ─▶ summary ─▶ cached ─▶ prepend it
          fails (offline, no CLI) ─▶ today's plain replay, nothing cached
```

A short space (≤ 12 messages total) never asks for one.

### Tools the agent gets

Every turn, in every mode, gets the `space-tools` MCP server: the space's
configured commands, never a shell of the agent's choosing.

| Tool | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `run_check` | the project's `check`, now: exit code + last lines |
| `start_app` / `stop_app` / `app_status` | the `run` command: start, stop, running?, ports, `http://localhost:<port>` |
| `read_logs` | the tail of `setup`, `run`, `check` or `archive` output (bounded) |
| `read_terminal` | one of the space's open terminals — id, title, running?, last lines (ANSI stripped); defaults to the most recently active one; a note, not an error, when none is open |
| `space_info` | name, branch, base, worktree, ports, env variable names (not values), which commands are set |
| `ship` | Open PR / Open as draft / Push / Merge locally / Keep as branch, as the Ship menu does (§6): PR number and URL, or why it was refused |
| `get_space_diff` | the change vs the merge-base with the base, uncommitted edits included; one `file`, or `stat` for +/− per file |
| `get_review_comments` | drafts, findings and threads on the space's review and its PR: `path:line`, who (you, an agent, a reviewer), state |
| `add_review_comment` | a finding on a line of the space's review: shows in Review, "Send to agent" sends it back |
| `set_base` | a new base branch: fetched, the diff is vs the merge-base from then on |
| `update_progress` | the turn's plan as steps (pending · active · done) above the composer |
| `ask_user` | asks you 1–3 multiple-choice questions and waits for the answer (§5 Questions) |

```
turn ─▶ token for this space ─▶ agent ─▶ run_check ─▶ check ─▶ result ─▶ agent fixes ─▶ …
  │                                  ├─▶ start_app ─▶ run   ─▶ URLs   ─▶ agent tries it
  │                                  └─▶ ship ─▶ ship_space (as the turn) ─▶ PR #n ─▶ agent tells you
  └─ agent exits ─▶ token revoked, progress cleared
```

- The system prompt names them: use `run_check` after changes, `start_app`
  to try the app, `ship` only when you ask to push, open a PR or merge.
- `ship` from the turn runs while that turn holds the space; any other
  caller still waits for the turn. It checkpoints the edits so far first,
  so they ship too; the turn's own checkpoint follows when it ends.
- `get_space_diff` snapshots the worktree through a temporary index: no
  ref moves, the worktree's own index stays as it was.
- `set_base` keeps the worktree and the turns; a PR that is already open
  keeps its target (the tool says so). Undo doesn't move the base back.
- The tracker is the turn's: each call replaces it, no steps clears it,
  and it goes when the turn ends.
- Trust holds: a repo command not allowed yet is refused with "not allowed
  by the user yet" and never runs.
- A command that isn't configured is no error, so no failed row: `run_check`
  answers `ran: false` and `start_app`/`app_status` a `note`, saying nothing
  ran and not to retry. A check that ran and failed says so (`passed: false`,
  its exit code and output tail).
- The turn lists its tool calls while it runs and after (§3 "A turn in the
  chat"), Theodore's own by what they do.
- Review chat, skills and fixes on a space's PR also get the read-only
  `read_logs` and `app_status` next to `review-tools`.

## 6. Git model

```
~/.theodore/repos/<host>/<owner>/<repo>.git    bare cache
   ├─ refs/heads/*                ◀── force-fetched from the remote, pruned
   ├─ refs/theodore/spaces/<id>   ──▶ last checkpoint   (Theodore's own ref)
   └─ refs/theodore/checkpoints/<id>/<sha>  every checkpoint, kept from gc
~/.theodore/spaces/<id>/          detached worktree: the agent's HEAD + uncommitted edits

turn ends ─▶ index ─copy─▶ temp index ─add -A─▶ write-tree ─▶ commit-tree -p HEAD "turn N"
          ─▶ update-ref refs/theodore/spaces/<id> + refs/theodore/checkpoints/<id>/<sha>
             (HEAD, branch and index untouched; same tree on same HEAD = same checkpoint)
Undo      ─▶ diff-tree <worktree now> <checkpoint> ─▶ rm what it lacks,
             checkout-index (temp index) what differs ─▶ reset --mixed <its HEAD> ─▶ ref
Update    ─▶ fetch ─▶ checkpoint ─▶ uncommitted edits become HEAD (mixed reset to that
             checkpoint, no file written) ─▶ git merge <base tip> ─▶ base_sha = tip
Ship      ─▶ commit-tree <checkpoint tree> -p <base> (author: you) ─▶ refs/theodore/shipped/<id>
Open PR   ─▶ git push origin <shipped>:refs/heads/<login>/<slug>   (never forced)
Push      ─▶ commit-tree <checkpoint tree> -p <last shipped> [-p <base tip merged since>] ─▶ push (fast-forward)
Merge     ─▶ (local folder) fetch <cache> <shipped ref> ─▶ git merge into its checked-out branch
Keep      ─▶ (local folder) fetch <cache> <shipped ref>:refs/heads/space/<slug>
Keep      ─▶ (local folder) git -C <folder> fetch <cache> <ref>:refs/heads/<branch>
Continue  ─▶ ls-remote + fetch <base> ─▶ tip ─▶ (turns not pushed) commit-tree 3-way onto tip
          ─▶ as Undo: HEAD = tip (mixed reset), files = that commit (only what differs),
             the unpushed turns uncommitted on it; update-ref refs/theodore/spaces/<id>
```

A push the host refuses says why, as an error toast; git's own text stays in
the log:

| git's stderr | The toast |
| --- | --- |
| `non-fast-forward`, `fetch first`, `[rejected]` | `<branch>` changed on the host since the last push; nothing was overwritten |
| `refusing to allow … workflow … without \`workflow\` scope` | GitHub needs the workflow permission to push changes under .github/workflows. Sign in to GitHub again in Theodore to grant it (with the gh CLI: gh auth refresh -s workflow), or push that file yourself. Theodore's sign-in asks for `repo read:org workflow`; a token from before it lacks `workflow` until you sign in again. |

Why detached plus a private ref, not a real branch in the cache:

| A branch under `refs/heads/` would… | Because |
| --- | --- |
| break every project refresh | `fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*` refuses to update a branch checked out in a worktree |
| be deleted before it is pushed | the same fetch runs with `--prune` |

Every turn is a commit, so the diff is commit-to-commit (cacheable, same as a
PR's revisions). A checkpoint is a snapshot, not a commit in the worktree:

| | Commit in the worktree (before) | Snapshot (now) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HEAD`, branch, index | moved, rewritten | as the agent left them |
| the agent's own commits | folded into "turn N" | kept as it made them |
| `turn_log` | `before` / `after` | + `before_head` / `after_head` (the `HEAD` under each) |
| Undo | `reset --hard` + `clean -fd`: every file touched | mixed reset + only the files that differ |
| unchanged file's mtime | bumped | kept |

Update from base is the one step that moves `HEAD`: the edits so far
become a commit (the checkpoint itself) and the merge goes on top, so a
turn that completed it records the merge commit as both `after` and
`after_head`.
Old checkpoints are commits that were `HEAD`, so a `turn_log` entry without
heads goes back with `HEAD` = the checkpoint itself; nothing is rewritten.
Shipping squashes the checkpoint's tree, so it ships both kinds the same
way. Each snapshot's parent is `HEAD`, not the checkpoint before it, so
`refs/theodore/checkpoints/<id>/<sha>` keeps every one reachable for Undo
and Push. A worktree recreated from the ref (unarchive) starts with `HEAD`
at the checkpoint. Checkpoints are authored by Theodore and never leave the
cache; what ships is one squashed commit authored by you (§12 #2).

**Worktree guard** (checkpoint, Undo, the busy check, reopen, archive):

```
git in ~/.theodore/spaces/<id>   GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=~/.theodore/spaces, no inherited GIT_DIR
  ├─ real dir, `.git` is a file, rev-parse --show-toplevel == the dir (symlinks resolved),
  │  common dir under ~/.theodore/repos                         ─▶ run the command
  └─ anything else (`.git` gone, a `git init` in its place, …)  ─▶ NotAWorktree, nothing run
```

The ceiling alone already makes git fail instead of walking up into a
git-controlled home; the guard says why. A directory that fails it is never
deleted: reopening the space (next turn, Undo, unarchive) or archiving it
moves it to `~/.theodore/spaces/.moved-aside/<id>-<millis>` and recreates the
worktree from `refs/theodore/spaces/<id>`.

**Busy worktree**: before a checkpoint or Undo Theodore asks git what is
unfinished there (`GitPort::worktree_busy`, one `WorktreeBusy`):

| Found (`rev-parse --git-path`, `ls-files -u`) | Busy |
| --- | --- |
| `rebase-merge/`, `rebase-apply/` | rebase (also `git am`) |
| `MERGE_HEAD` | merge |
| `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` | cherry-pick |
| `REVERT_HEAD` | revert |
| unmerged index entries, none of the above | unresolved conflicts |

| While busy | |
| --- | --- |
| a turn ends | answer kept, no checkpoint, no `turn_log` entry; space `failed` with "checkpoint skipped: rebase in progress" |
| Undo | refused: "can't undo: … finish or abort it first" |
| Archive, Ship | refused with the same reason; nothing half-done is committed, and a refused Archive leaves `run` and the terminals running |
| next turn after it's finished | checkpoints as usual |

That is for an operation nobody told Theodore about (the agent ran `git
rebase` itself). A merge Theodore started for Update from base is recorded
on the space (`space.updating`), and its flow owns the end of it.

**Update from base** (owner, 2026-10-31: merge the base in, never rebase or
force-push, so pushed history and reviewers' comments stay put; shipping
still squashes):

```
Update ─▶ fetch the base ─▶ tip == base_sha? ─▶ "already up to date"
  └─▶ checkpoint "edits before updating from main" (= from, a snapshot)
      └─▶ mixed reset to from: its edits become HEAD's own, no file written
      └─▶ git merge --no-edit --ff <tip>   (Theodore's identity, no hooks, merge.conflictStyle=diff3)
            ├─ clean ─────▶ merge commit = checkpoint "merge main" ─▶ base_sha = tip ─▶ diff vs tip
            └─ conflicts ─▶ merge left in progress, space.updating = { base_tip, from, conflicts, started_at }
                              └─▶ agent turn (Edit; an Ask space switches to Edit): the files,
                                  "resolve the markers, keep both intents, run_check, leave git to Theodore"
                                  turn ends ─▶ space_merge_finish instead of the checkpoint:
                                    ├─ no file it listed has a marker line ─▶ add -A, commit = checkpoint,
                                    │     base_sha = tip, updating cleared, turn_log.base_before = old base
                                    ├─ markers left ─▶ no checkpoint, failed "conflicts left in b.ts; …"
                                    ├─ the agent committed the merge itself ─▶ that commit is checkpointed
                                    └─ the agent aborted it ─▶ checkpoint, old base, updating cleared
            Abort ─▶ merge --abort, reset --hard <from>, clean -fd, ref → from, updating cleared
```

- A file counts as resolved when no line starts with `<<<<<<<`, `|||||||`
  or `>>>>>>>` (or it is deleted): the agent needn't `git add`, which its
  sandbox may not allow (the index lives in the cache), and `git add` alone
  resolves nothing: a staged file with markers still counts as left.
- Shipping after an update: the base is a real parent of the space's head,
  so the squashed commit stays correct.

  | Ship | the new commit |
  | --- | --- |
  | Open PR / first Merge locally | parent = the new `base_sha`, tree = the merged checkpoint: one commit vs the new base |
  | Push (PR open) | parents = last push + the base tip merged since (dropped when already in its history), tree = the merged checkpoint: fast-forward, and the host's PR diff (vs the merge base) is still the change alone |
  | Merge locally again | the same second parent |

**Shipping, step by step**

- *Author*: `user.name` / `user.email` as git resolves them (a local
  folder's own config first, then the cache's, i.e. your global one); on
  GitHub without either, your login with its noreply address. Unsigned:
  Theodore can't answer a passphrase prompt. Message: the title (editable
  in the confirm popover, default the goal's first line; after a Continue,
  the round's net-change summary, §3 "Continue"), then the goal when it
  says more.
- *Open PR*: the commit's parent is the base. If the branch name is
  already taken on the host, nothing is pushed. After the push the outbox
  item `create_space_pr` asks the host for an open PR from that branch
  first and only then creates one; a create the host refuses as a
  duplicate is looked up again. The push is on record before the body is
  filled in, and a branch whose tip is the space's own last squash isn't a
  name taken. So a retry — after a timeout, a crash, or clicking Open PR again
  after a failure — never opens a second PR, and a retry with no new turns
  pushes nothing.
- *PR body*: the repo's PR template when the change has one, else the
  goal (when it says more than the title); then a link back to the space.

  ```
  template? first of .github/pull_request_template.md · .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
            · docs/pull_request_template.md · pull_request_template.md   (at the checkpoint)
    yes ─▶ the space's agent fills it in (read-only, Claude on haiku, 60 s,
    │      from the goal + changed files) ─▶ kept only if every heading survived
    │      └─ failed / timed out / dropped headings ─▶ goal + the template as is
    no  ─▶ the goal
  then  ─▶ <!-- theodore-space:<id> -->
           <sub>From a Theodore space: theodore://space/<id></sub>
  ```

  The footer is added once: an existing one (from the marker on) is
  replaced, never repeated. The link uses the build's own scheme
  (`theodore-staging://…`); opening it brings the window forward and
  opens the space (`apps/desktop/src/deep_link.rs`), also when it launched
  the app: the shell keeps it until the UI listens (`take_pending_space`).
  It's plain text, not a markdown link: hosts don't make custom schemes
  clickable.
- *Continue* (§7): the new round's branch is the old one plus `-2` (a
  continued branch counts on: `-3`, `-4`), skipping a name another space,
  an earlier round or the host already has. Its base is the base branch's
  tip fetched now; turns after the last push (not in the merged PR) are
  replayed onto it three-way, and refused if that conflicts.
- *Push*: one more commit on top of the last pushed one, so reviewers'
  history and comments stay put. No force push, ever:

  | PR branch on the host | the new commit |
  | --- | --- |
  | where the last push left it | parent = last push, tree = latest checkpoint |
  | moved (someone pushed to it) | parent = their tip, tree = their tip + the turns since the last push (three-way, no worktree); refused if that conflicts |
  | gone | parent = last push, pushed again |

  Its message says what changed, never what was said: the net change
  since the last push, summarized the way a round's PR title is (§3
  "Continue"): the chat agent's proposed title and whole-sentence lines,
  else `Update <path>` / `Update N files in <dir>/`. Your messages, a
  feedback prompt or a Fix CI prompt never go into git.

- *Merge locally*: refused, folder untouched, on a dirty working tree
  (untracked files count), a detached `HEAD`, or a merge that would
  conflict (checked first with `git merge-tree`, before the index or any
  file changes). Otherwise a normal `git merge` (fast-forward when it can
  be) with the user's own hooks; a merge that still fails is aborted. The
  objects come over with `fetch --no-write-fetch-head`: no `FETCH_HEAD`,
  no extra ref. A second merge after more turns brings only those turns.
- *Keep as branch*: writes `refs/heads/space/<slug>` in the folder and
  nothing else; refused if that branch exists.

### Mirror into a local folder

Some projects can't run from a separate worktree at all — fixed ports, one
local database, a docker compose stack, an IDE run config bound to the
folder's own path. "Try in my folder" writes the space's working state
straight into the user's own checkout instead, so they run it there while
the space keeps drafting.

```
Mirror on  ─▶ folder clean (untracked count) ─▶ remember its HEAD + branch
           ─▶ first sync: write what changed since the space's own base
turn ends / "Sync now" ─▶ re-sync: only the paths that changed are rewritten
Mirror off ─▶ restore every mirrored path to its content at the remembered HEAD
           ─▶ refused if the folder disagrees with what mirroring wrote there
              (shows which paths), unless Discard
```

- **At most one space per folder.** Turning mirroring on for another space
  of the same project turns it off for whichever one had it first — the
  same edited-folder refusal applies to that switch, so it can be blocked
  too until it's resolved there.
- **Only working tree files move.** The folder's branch, `HEAD` and index
  are never touched by mirroring, in either direction; ignored files
  (deps, build output) are never part of the space's tree in the first
  place (a checkpoint is `git add -A`), so they're never part of a sync.
- **One-way.** Edits made in the folder are never synced back into the
  space — the banner says so while it's on.
- **No file watcher.** A turn is already the space's unit of change, so
  mirroring re-syncs after every turn and on "Sync now"; nothing watches
  the worktree between turns. Simpler than a watcher, and just as current
  in practice (`crates/app/src/usecases/mirror.rs`).
- **Paused, not auto-resumed.** A mirror still `On` when Theodore last
  closed comes back `Paused` on startup — nothing is ever written into a
  folder without the window having been open to show it
  (`pause_resumed_mirrors`). Resuming re-checks the folder is clean, the
  same as turning it on fresh.

Git plumbing (`crates/git/src/mirror.rs`): every operation fetches the
space's checkpoint ref into the folder first (objects only, the same
`--no-write-fetch-head` shape as `merge_into_folder`/`write_folder_branch`:
no `FETCH_HEAD`, no new ref), then a temporary index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`) —
never the folder's own — does the rest:

| Step | How |
| --- | --- |
| Which paths changed | `git diff --name-only` between two checkpoints (ancestry doesn't matter, so this is correct even across an Undo) |
| Write them | `read-tree` the target commit into a temp index, `checkout-index` just those paths |
| Remove a dropped path | deleted directly (not in the target tree, so `checkout-index` has nothing for it) |
| Was a path edited since | temp index of the last mirrored commit, then `git diff --name-only` with no revision args — the default "index vs working tree" comparison, by content, never a timestamp |
| Restore on Mirror off | the same temp-index checkout, from the remembered `HEAD` |

`Space.mirror` doesn't store a per-sync diff: it keeps `touched`, the
union of every sync's changed paths since mirroring turned on. A path the
agent added and later removed again has no net difference between the
remembered `HEAD` and the latest checkpoint, but still needs watching and
restoring — the union catches it; a single two-commit diff at Mirror-off
time would not.

## 7. Lifecycle and data

New synced model `space` (core-owned, written only by commands):

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `project`, `name`, `goal` | `goal` is the first message |
| `branch`, `base`, `base_sha`, `head_sha` | `branch` (`<login>/<slug>`, `space/<slug>` without a login) is pushed on Open PR; `head_sha` = last checkpoint |
| `worktree` | absolute path |
| `status` | `idle · running · failed · archived` |
| `agent`, `model`, `mode` | sticky per space |
| `review_pr` | the branch review the diff and Review use |
| `pr` | the host PR, once opened — the link from drafting to review |
| `usage`, `turns`, `error`, `created_at`, `updated_at` | |
| `attention_at` | when something last asked for you: a turn ended or failed, or a question came. Drives the ● and the dock badge. Written with `updated_at`, the value the page's seen mark stores, so looking at the page always covers it; empty on spaces with no such event yet (they fall back to `updated_at`) |
| `shipped` | the last ship: `how` (`pr · merged_locally · branch`), `branch`, `sha` (the squashed commit), `head` (the checkpoint it came from — later turns are "not pushed"), `pushes`, `at` |
| `done_at` | set when the PR merges (seen by the poller's spaces sweep) or on Merge locally / Keep as branch; cleared by Continue |
| `turn_log` | per turn: your message and the reply (`chat_message` ids), messages steered into it (`steered`), checkpoint `before` / `after` and the worktree's `HEAD` under each (`before_head` / `after_head`, none on old entries), `undone`; `base_before` when the turn completed an Update from base (Undo puts that base back); a Revert is an entry too, with `reverted` paths and its own message as `reply` |
| `worktree_head` | the worktree's `HEAD` under `head_sha` (none: `head_sha` is `HEAD`) |
| `title` | the chat agent's proposed title (§3 "New space"); `None` until it lands |
| `handoff_summary` | the earlier conversation, summarized once and cached (§5 "One session per space") |
| `progress` | the running turn's tracker (`update_progress`): `steps` (label, `pending · active · done`), `note`, `at`; `null` once the turn ends |
| `updating` | an Update from base resolving its conflicts: `base_tip`, `from` (the checkpoint it started at), `conflicts`, `started_at` (§6) |
| `rounds` | earlier rounds of a continued space, oldest first: the merged `pr`, its `branch`, `base_sha`, the last pushed `head_sha`, `at` |
| `continue_note` | after Continue: one line the next turn's prompt opens with, then cleared |
| `mirror` | mirroring into the project's local folder (§6 "Mirror into a local folder"): `status` (`on · paused`), `remembered_head`, `remembered_branch`, `mirrored_head`, `touched`; `None` when it was never turned on, or after Mirror off |

| Data | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Transcript | `chat_message` rows with `pr = "space:<id>"` — the chat model, bootstrap and UI already work on it. A message waiting for its turn carries `queued` (§8); a reply carries its turn's `activity`, `duration_ms`, `changed_files` and `model` (§3 "A turn in the chat") |
| Streaming text, tool and thinking lines | `Ephemeral::AgentDelta` / `RunLog` / `RunStep` / `RunStepDone` / `RunTextBreak` with run id `space:<id>:<msg>`; not persisted (the reply's `activity` is) |
| A turn | on the space row: `status`, `turns`, `head_sha`, and an entry in `turn_log` (what undo moves back to). Later: `space_run` rows (agent, mode, usage, session id) for per-turn diffs and native resume |
| Code | the worktree and `refs/theodore/spaces/<id>` |

**Archive** checkpoints any uncommitted edits, removes the worktree, keeps the
ref and the rows. The space page's Archive button does it at any time (not
while a turn runs). **Unarchive** (the archived banner's button, or ⌘K) recreates the
worktree from the ref and reopens the live diff; archived spaces are found
by searching ⌘K. A done space starts its auto-archive countdown again from
the unarchive. If the ref is gone the worktree starts over at the base and
the space says so (`failed`, "the checkpoints were gone").
**Auto-archive**: once a minute the poller re-fetches each in-review space's
PR, sets `done_at` when it has merged, and archives spaces done for
`spaces.auto_archive_days` (default 7, `0` = never; Settings → Spaces). A PR
closed without merging leaves the space alone. Space worktrees live outside
`~/.theodore/wt`, so the PR worktree sweep never touches them.

**Continue after merge** (`continue_space`): a merged space goes on as the
next round instead of waiting to be archived.

```
merged #123 ─▶ Continue ─┬─ running / archived / PR not merged / offline ─▶ refused
                         └─▶ fetch the base ─▶ tip
                              worktree + ref ─▶ tip (+ turns not pushed, replayed)
                              branch ─▶ ada/rate-limits-2
                              rounds += { #123, ada/rate-limits, … }
                              pr · shipped · done_at ─▶ cleared   (drafting again)
                              continue_note ─▶ the next turn's prompt:
                                "the previous pull request (#123, branch …) was
                                 merged into main … continues on ada/rate-limits-2"
```

Turns, transcript, the agent session and the review id stay. Undo can't
go back past Continue (the space moved since its last turn). With `pr`
and `done_at` cleared the sweep has nothing to archive; a sweep that
found the old PR merged while Continue ran re-reads the row under the
ship lock and leaves it alone.

| Once the PR merged | |
| --- | --- |
| Update from base (§6) | off: "Base moved" hides and the core refuses; Continue is the way onto the new base |
| An Update from base still resolving | Continue waits: complete or abort it first |

Not built yet: **Delete** (archive plus deleting the ref and the chat rows);
**GC** (archived spaces whose branch was never pushed lose their ref after
`spaces.gc_days`, 30); removing a project archiving its spaces first.

**Crash recovery**

| Found on start | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `status = running` | → `failed` "interrupted: Theodore was closed" |
| queued messages | kept, held: each waits for its Send (§8) |
| dirty worktree | kept; the next turn (or archive) checkpoints it first |
| worktree dir missing | recreated from `refs/theodore/spaces/<id>` |
| dir there, but not the space's worktree (`.git` gone or foreign) | git refuses to run in it (§6 "Worktree guard"); on reopen or archive it is moved to `spaces/.moved-aside/`, never deleted, and recreated from the ref |
| a rebase, merge or conflict left in the worktree | no checkpoint or Undo until it is finished or aborted (§6 "Busy worktree") |
| `updating` set (an Update from base was resolving) | kept: the merge is still in the worktree; Complete merge or Abort from the banner, or send the agent a message |
| ref missing too | `failed`, transcript kept, "Restart from base" offered |

---

## 8. Concurrency

One run per space at a time. A send while it runs is **queued**: stored as
your `chat_message` with `queued` (`seq`, the agent / model / mode picked,
`held`) and shown under the running turn, not in the transcript yet.
Attachments go with it; a `/skill` is expanded when it runs, from the
worktree as it is then.

```
send ─▶ running? ── no ──▶ turn now
           └─ yes ─▶ queued #n ──▶ turn ends ─┬─ on its own ─▶ #1 runs, then #2 …
                                              └─ stopped · failed · restart
                                                   └─▶ held: Send · Edit · Cancel
```

| Turn ended | The queue |
| --- | --- |
| on its own (a failing `check` included: the next turn hears it) | the first waiting message runs as the next turn, then the next |
| stopped (also during its checkpoint or `check`) | held: nothing is sent, nothing dropped |
| failed, its checkpoint skipped, conflicts left, or a queued one couldn't start | held |
| Theodore restarted | held (§7 Crash recovery) |

- **Edit** changes a queued message's text, **Cancel** deletes it; both
  only while it is queued.
- **Send** on a held message runs it now when the space is free; while a
  turn runs it goes back in line. Held ones never send on their own, and a
  new message while some are held runs at once.
- A queued message's picks win over the space's when it runs; `None` means
  whatever the space has then. Its turn is a normal one: undo, session
  resume and the replayed transcript treat it like any other.
- **Undo** and **Archive** leave the queue as it is. An archived space sends
  nothing (Send is refused); after Unarchive the held messages can be sent.
- A per-space lock covers "send now or queue" and "turn ends → next queued
  starts", so a send never slips in between and the order holds.

**Send now (steer).** For a Claude Code turn the composer also offers
*Send now* (⌘⏎; ⏎ still queues): the message goes into the running turn and
the agent takes it at its next step. Claude Code reads messages from stdin
while it runs (`--input-format stream-json --replay-user-messages`, checked
on 2.1.312): one written mid-run joins the turn after the current tool call
and is echoed back when taken; one that lands just as the turn ends starts
another turn in the same process and session. The run ends — stdin closed —
once every message was taken and answered; the reply is all the answers.

```
claude -p --input-format stream-json …   stdin ◀─ goal
   tool call … ◀────────────────────────── stdin ◀─ "also handle 404s"  (Send now)
   echo: taken ─▶ … ─▶ result ─▶ all taken? ─▶ close stdin ─▶ exit ─▶ checkpoint
```

| | Send now |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code, same agent and mode, no attachments | into the running turn; listed in the turn's `steered`, undone with it |
| Codex, Gemini (one prompt per process) | queued |
| another agent / mode, attachments (`--add-dir` is per process) | queued |
| the run just ended, or hasn't started taking input yet | queued |

The runner exposes it as an optional capability (`AgentPort::run_steerable`
returns a `Steer` handle or none). A message written but never taken within
30 s of the run's last result closes stdin anyway, so a run never waits on
input forever.

Spaces run in parallel, each in its own worktree. v2: `spaces.max_parallel`
(default 3) queues the rest. Git writes into the shared bare cache (fetch,
`update-ref`, `worktree add/remove`) and into one space's worktree
(checkpoint, reset) each take a per-path lock (plan §7 "One writer at a
time"), so a turn's checkpoint never races a project refresh.

**Offline.** A space of a host project needs the network only to Open PR /
Push. Creating it, sending, undo, archive and Review use the clone already
on this Mac when the remote can't be reached (plan §7 "Offline"); only a
project never cloned answers "You're offline and this project hasn't been
downloaded to this Mac yet".

## 9. Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `create_space` | worktree + ref at the base, `space` row; sends `goal` as turn 1 when given |
| `list_spaces` | rows of one project or all (the UI reads the synced rows) |
| `space_send` | chat row, then a turn in the worktree; checkpoint; refresh the diff. While a turn runs: a queued chat row (§8) |
| `space_send_now` | into the running Claude turn when it can take it (§8 "Send now"), else as `space_send` |
| `space_queued` | `send` · `cancel` · `edit` one queued message |
| `space_stop` | cancels the running turn; the queue is held |
| `save_attachment` | stores a file (≤ 25 MB) for a message; `attachment_data` reads it back as a `data:` URL |
| `space_skills` | skills `/<id>` can run: `~/.claude/skills` plus the worktree's `.claude/skills`, no built-ins |
| `space_review` | opens (or refreshes) the space's branch review; `group: true` also groups it |
| `archive_space` | checkpoint, remove the worktree, keep the ref |
| `unarchive_space` | recreate the worktree from the ref, reopen the live diff |
| `undo_space_turn` | worktree and ref back to the last live turn's `before`; the turn is marked undone |
| `set_space_pinned` | `space.pinned`; pinned spaces sort first (sidebar, ⌘K) — never touches `updated_at` |
| `rewind_space` | "Back to here": back to right after the turn of `reply`; every later turn undone |
| `revert_space_file` | `paths` as in the base (`from: base`) or before the last agent turn (`last_turn`); checkpointed as a `turn_log` entry; the next prompt says so |
| `space_send_feedback` | threads / drafts / findings of the space's PR or own review, quoted as one turn |
| `space_base_status` | the base's tip in the copy on this Mac and how many commits the space is behind it; no network |
| `update_space_from_base` | merge the base's tip into the space (§6); while `updating`, complete that merge if no markers are left |
| `abort_space_update` | `merge --abort`, back to `updating.from` on the old base |
| `approve_space_plan` | the last turn's plan as the next turn, in the space's `build_mode` |
| `answer_space_question` | your answers to a waiting `ask_user`; refused when they don't fit its options |
| `ship_space` | `open_pr` · `open_draft_pr` · `push` (host project) or `merge_locally` · `keep_branch` (local folder), with an optional title (§6) |
| `space_setup_assist` | "Set up with agent": no `spaces:` commands at all — a turn asking the agent to look at the repo and write them (`docs/config.md` §2, §8) |
| `space_fix_setup` | "Fix with agent": setup failed — a turn with the command, its exit status and the log tail, asking the agent to fix the cause |
| `open_space_terminal` | a new PTY in the worktree (§3 "Terminal"), `$SHELL -l`, given `cols`/`rows` |
| `write_space_terminal` | bytes typed or pasted into it |
| `resize_space_terminal` | a new `cols`/`rows` (`SIGWINCH`) |
| `close_space_terminal` | kills its process group |
| `list_space_terminals` | a space's open (or just-exited) terminals, each with scrollback to reseed the view |
| `space_fix_ci` | "Fix with agent" on the Checks tab: the space PR's failing checks' logs (or links), as one turn |
| `merge_space` | merges the space's PR: an optional method, else the host's default; now, auto-merge or the merge queue (§3); refused with turns not pushed |
| `continue_space` | after the PR merged: a new branch on the base's fresh tip, the round kept (§7) |
| `mirror_space` | "Mirror into `<folder>`": on fresh, or resuming a paused one (§6 "Mirror into a local folder") |
| `sync_mirror` | "Sync now": re-syncs by hand; a no-op when mirroring is off or paused |
| `unmirror_space` | "Mirror off": restores the folder; refused (named paths, unless `discard`) if it was edited meanwhile |

## 10. The flag

| | on (default) | turned off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sidebar section, route, palette items, keys | present | absent |
| Settings → Spaces | present, switch on | present, switch off |
| Core commands | used | registered, unused |

On = `FEATURES.buildMode || setting labs.build_mode != false` (user scope):
no row, or `true`, means on. The flag forces them on and locks the switch.

---

## 11. Phasing

| Phase | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| **Built** | `space` model; create / send / stop / review / archive; transcript in chat rows; checkpoint per turn; live diff during a turn; sidebar section with the `⎇ #n` glyph; space page with chat + diff; Review opens the grouped review; crash → failed. Start from a goal, an issue (yours first, or a pasted URL / `#n`), a branch or a PR. Shipping: squash into one commit by you; Open PR / Open as draft (`HostAdapter::create_pr` + `find_open_pr` on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, sandbox and fixtures, through the outbox, idempotent by head branch), filled from the repo's PR template and linking back (`theodore://space/<id>`), and Push (never forced); branch `<login>/<slug>`; Merge locally and Keep as branch for local folders; modes Ask / Edit / Run; Archive button and `spaces.auto_archive_days`; Unarchive; Undo last turn (`turn_log`). In review on the space page: Changes · Threads · Checks tabs, Merge (`merge_space`: host default method, auto-merge, merge queue), Continue after merge (`continue_space`, `rounds`). "Send to agent" on a space PR's / own review's threads, drafts and findings, and the "Send N to agent" footer, both marking what was sent (`sent_feedback`). One agent session per space (Claude Code `--resume`, Codex `exec resume`); sends while running are queued (held after Stop / a failure / a restart; Send · Edit · Cancel) and Send now steers a running Claude Code turn. Background notifications and the dock badge (`spaces.notify`). Names transliterated from Cyrillic and accented goals, `-2` for repeats; a chat-agent-proposed name and title in the background, never delaying turn 1 (`space_naming`); a cached, once-generated handoff summary for a space that outgrows the replayed window (`space_handoff`). `setup` / `run` / `check` / `archive` from the project config (`docs/config.md`) with logs and Open app; `copy` and `ports` default to `.env*` and 2 with zero config; "Set up with agent" for setup and "Fix with agent" on the Checks tab, sending a failing check's log (GitHub Actions) or link as one turn. Update from base (merge, never rebase): "Base moved: N commits behind", conflicts resolved by an agent turn, Complete merge / Abort. The agent's `space-tools` for the change: `ship`, `get_space_diff`, `get_review_comments`, `add_review_comment`, `set_base`, `update_progress` (the tracker above the composer), `read_terminal` over `space_terminal_tail`. Interactive terminal tabs (§3 "Terminal") over a real PTY, surviving navigation, closed on archive / app quit; `@terminal` in the composer attaching a terminal's tail as a text attachment. Mirroring into a local folder's own working tree — on / Sync now / off with Discard, at most one per folder, paused (not auto-written) across a restart (§6 "Mirror into a local folder") |
| **v2** | My PRs "Drafting" group; feedback tracked as tasks; `space_run` rows and per-turn diffs; Delete and ref GC; `max_parallel`; Continue for a space merged locally or kept as a branch |
| **Later** | OS sandbox for agents; signed shipped commits; spaces started from a failing check; several agents racing one goal, pick the best diff |

## 12. Decisions (owner, 2026-10-21)

| # | Question | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Branch name on ship | `<login>/<slug>` (the host login; `space/<slug>` when there is none) |
| 2 | Checkpoint commits on ship | squashed into one commit, authored by you, message from the goal |
| 3 | Draft or ready | **Open PR** opens a ready PR; its dropdown offers *Open as draft* (and any other modes) |
| 4 | Run mode safety | no extra sandbox: Run mode trusts the agent CLI as configured |
| 5 | Local folder end state | **Merge locally**: a normal merge of the squashed commit into the folder's checked-out branch, instead of a PR; *Keep as branch* stays as the alternative |
| 6 | Budget | none: budgets, and showing spend at all, were dropped by the owner on 2026-10-22. Nothing is limited, no cost is shown, and an old `budget.*` setting is ignored |
| 7 | Archive | a setting `spaces.auto_archive_days` (default 7, `0` = never) plus an **Archive** button on the space at any time |
