//! Code intelligence (docs/code-intel.md): symbols, references, definitions
//! and diagnostics over a worktree. Shared by the syntax layer
//! (tree-sitter), the semantic layer (LSP), the toolchain that installs
//! grammars and servers, and `app`, which exposes them as MCP tools.
//!
//! ```text
//! question ─▶ server ready? ── yes ─▶ lsp     (Source::Lsp)
//!                            └─ no ──▶ syntax  (Source::Syntax)
//!                                      └─ gaps ─▶ text search (Source::Text)
//! ```
//!
//! Positions: `line` and `col` are 1-based; `col` counts Unicode scalar
//! values (chars) in the line, not bytes and not UTF-16 units. Each layer
//! converts at its edge (tree-sitter bytes, LSP UTF-16 or UTF-8).
