//! Worktree garbage collection. `GitPort::gc_worktrees` already exists and

//! nothing in the running app ever called it, so a PR's worktree outlived
//! every review of it. This wires a periodic sweep around it.
//!
//! The one thing a sweep must never do is remove a worktree a run is
//! actively using (an agent mid-review, a commit-and-push in flight):
//! `WorktreeLocks` is a refcount `Core`/the agent runner can hold one of
//! for exactly that long, always unioned into the sweep's `keep` list.
